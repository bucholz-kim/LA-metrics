FYI for the future study,
1) Sensitivity for local soil moisture over CONUS [Koster et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0192.1),
2) Impact of wind direction on rainfall over irrigated areas [Greve et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58729-y),
3) Potential way of catching the original source of rainfall for irriation impact: the quasi-isentropic back-trajectory scheme (QIBT) [Dirmeyer et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.11.016).
