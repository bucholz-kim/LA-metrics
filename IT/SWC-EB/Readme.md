**Monthly Relationship between Soil Water Content (SWC) and Surface Energy Budget (SEB)**
  *among flux site observations, reanalyses, and climate models*


  Fig01. Monthly vairations of SEB: net radation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (SH), and ground heat flux (GH)
                        and SWC
  
  Fig02. Hysteresis between SWC-SEB and SWC-evaporative fraction (EF)
      + Signed Area

  Fig03. Same as Fig01 but EF and its ratio by LE and SH

  Fig04. Same as Fig01 but correation (CORR), normalized mutual information (NMI), and linearity by NMI.
