**Monthly Relationship between Soil Water Content (SWC) and Surface Energy Budget (SEB)**
  *among flux site observations, reanalyses, and climate models*


  Fig01. Monthly vairations of SEB: net radation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (SH), and ground heat flux (GH)
                        and SWC

      : checking on both sign and magnitude

      + Futher application:
        CAPE, CIN, CTP, banana plot ([Seo and Dirmeyer, 2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5411-2022)),

  any hysteresis between two variables for diurnal, daily, monthly, yearly cycles.
  Fig03. Same as Fig01 but EF and its ratio by LE and SH

  Fig04. Same as Fig01 but correation (CORR), normalized mutual information (NMI), and linearity by NMI.
