**Monthly Relationship between Soil Water Content (SWC) and Surface Energy Budget (SEB)**
  *among flux site observations, reanalyses, and climate models*

      any hysteresis between two variables for diurnal, daily, monthly, and yearly cycles.


  Fig03. Same as Fig01 but EF and its ratio by LE and SH

  Fig04. Same as Fig01 but correation (CORR), normalized mutual information (NMI), and linearity by NMI.
